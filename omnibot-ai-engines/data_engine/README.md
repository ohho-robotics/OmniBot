# OmniBot Data Engine

Tooling for collecting, converting, validating, and loading robot demonstrations
in **LeRobot v2.0 format** (Parquet + MP4 video) for SmolVLA training.

## Format

All datasets use the LeRobot v2.0 layout:

```
dataset/
  meta/
    info.json          ← fps, total_episodes, total_frames, feature shapes
    tasks.jsonl        ← task index → task string
    episodes.jsonl     ← episode index → task list, length
    stats.json         ← per-feature mean/std/min/max for normalisation
  data/
    chunk-000/
      episode_000000.parquet   ← state, action, timestamps (one row per frame)
  videos/
    chunk-000/
      observation.images.wrist/episode_000000.mp4
      observation.images.bev/episode_000000.mp4
```

State and action are the unified **9-D** mobile-manipulation spec (6 arm joints
+ 3 base velocities), defined in `schema/constants.py`
(`MOBILE_MANIP_STATE_SPEC` / `MOBILE_MANIP_ACTION_SPEC`). Camera streams written
to the dataset are `observation.images.wrist` and `observation.images.bev`
(wrist close-up and the stitched bird's-eye view). Those two keys are defined
once in `schema/camera_keys.py`. The physical front camera feeds the BEV
stitcher and is not a dataset feature.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -e .          # installs the `vla_data_engine` package
# or: pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### ROS 2 bag → dataset (single episode)
```bash
python -m data_engine.ingestion.bag_to_omnibot \
    --bag /data/bags/ep000 \
    --dataset /data/lerobot/pick_place \
    --task "pick up the red cube" \
    --fps 30
```

### Batch convert
```bash
python -m data_engine.scripts.ingest_dataset \
    --input-dir /data/bags \
    --output-dir /data/lerobot/pick_place \
    --task "pick up the red cube"
```

### Validate
```bash
python -m data_engine.scripts.validate_dataset --dataset /data/lerobot/pick_place
```

### Quality filter (OHH-99)

Filter out corrupted demonstrations before policy training and output a keep/reject report:

```bash
python -m data_engine.scripts.filter_episodes \
    --dataset /data/lerobot/pick_place \
    --output /data/lerobot/pick_place/meta/filter_results.json
```

#### Rejection Rules & CLI Thresholds

An episode is rejected if any of the following conditions occur:
1. **Frozen video**: Identical consecutive frames for >0.5 s (`--max-frozen-s 0.5`).
2. **Camera timestamp skew**: Wrist vs bird's-eye view camera timestamp delta >50 ms (`--max-camera-skew-s 0.05` or `--max-camera-skew-ms 50.0`).
   - `--missing-camera-timestamps {unchecked,reject}` (default: `unchecked`): When separate per-camera timestamps are missing, the skew is not measured (`max_camera_skew_s` is reported as `null`). In `unchecked` mode, the episode is kept and the report notes `camera_skew: unchecked (no per-camera timestamps)` with a count in the summary. In `reject` mode, episodes without per-camera timestamps are rejected with that reason.
   - *Recorder Gap*: Ingested LeRobot v2.0 datasets standardly write a single shared `timestamp` column. Measuring camera skew requires per-camera timestamp columns (e.g., `observation.images.wrist.timestamp`, `observation.images.bev.timestamp`) or sidecar timestamp arrays (`videos/.../{episode}_timestamps.npy`). Safe recorder node changes to expose hardware frame timestamps require ROS 2 Jazzy and physical/simulated cameras to verify.
3. **Joint step**: Joint position change >0.5 rad between consecutive frames (`--max-joint-step-rad 0.5`).
   - Evaluates shortest angular distance across the $\pm\pi$ wrap for continuous joints (configured via `--continuous-joints`, default: `wrist_roll`). Limited joints such as `shoulder_pan` (limited to $[-1.92, 1.92]$ rad per the robot URDF in `omnibot.urdf.xacro`) retain raw differences so large steps are rejected.
4. **Short episode**: Episode duration shorter than 2.0 s (`--min-duration-s 2.0`).

The filter outputs a JSON report with summary statistics, lists of `kept` and `rejected` episode indices, and per-episode metrics and failure reasons. In synthetic tests or environments without video codecs, `FrameSource` abstracts frame access and loads `.npy` arrays directly.

> **Demonstration Count Rule (OHH-49)**:
> OHH-49 ("Collect 50–100 demonstrations of one manipulation task") demonstration counts must **only** include episodes that this quality filter keeps (`status == "keep"`, listed in `kept`). Flawed episodes (frozen camera, timestamp skew, long pauses, or joint jumps) must be discarded and excluded from demonstration counts and policy training sets.

### Visualise an episode
```bash
python -m data_engine.visualization.visualize_episode \
    --dataset /data/lerobot/pick_place \
    --episode 0
```
